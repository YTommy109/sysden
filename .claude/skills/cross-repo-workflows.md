# Cross-Repo Workflows

Use this when a task spans multiple repositories, shared libraries, downstream
consumers, or a multi-repo watch daemon.

<!-- dagayn skill embedding context -->
## Installed Search Mode

Installed in FTS-only mode (`--mode fts-only`).

- Treat `semantic_search_nodes_tool` as keyword/FTS search, not vector semantic search.
- `search_mode` should normally be `fts_only`; `keyword_fallback` means the FTS index is absent and should be refreshed before quality claims.
- Prefer exact symbols, file names, graph relationships, and one targeted `rg` for literals.
- Do not rebuild embeddings unless the user explicitly changes install mode.

## Workflow

1. List known repositories:
   ```bash
   dagayn tool list_repos_tool
   dagayn repos
   ```
2. Register missing repos explicitly:
   ```bash
   dagayn register /path/to/repo --alias short-name
   dagayn daemon add /path/to/repo
   ```
3. Keep graphs fresh:
   ```bash
   dagayn daemon status
   dagayn daemon start
   dagayn daemon logs
   ```
4. Search structurally across repos:
   ```bash
   dagayn tool cross_repo_search_tool --arg query='"billing client"' --arg detail_level='"minimal"'
   ```
5. After cross-repo candidates are identified, switch back to the relevant repo
   and use local graph tools such as `query_graph_tool`, `review_tool`, or
   `semantic_search_nodes_tool` for source-level verification.

## Safety Rules

- Never assume a registered repo is fresh. Check daemon status or run a local
  `build_or_update_graph_tool()` before relying on a result.
- Cross-repo search is for candidate discovery. Confirm behavior in the owning
  repo before recommending edits.
- Use aliases in reports so users can tell which repo each finding came from.

## Efficiency Rules

- Use cross-repo search to narrow the candidate set before any broad `rg` across
  multiple checkout roots.
- Keep source reads repo-local and targeted after cross-repo discovery.
